\arguments{
\item{input}{Input data, which can be provided as either a
\code{SpatialExperiment} object or a numeric matrix. If this is a
\code{SpatialExperiment} object, it is assumed to contain either raw
expression counts or logcounts in the \code{assay} slots and spatial
coordinates in the \code{spatialCoords} slot. If this is a numeric matrix,
it is assumed to contain either raw expression counts or logcounts, and
spatial coordinates need to be provided separately with the
\code{spatialcoords} argument.}

\item{assay_name}{For a \code{SpatialExperiment} input object, this argument
specifies the name of the \code{assay} containing the expression values to
be smoothed. In most cases, this will be \code{counts}, which contains raw
expression counts. Alternatively, \code{logcounts} may also be used. Note
that if \code{logcounts} are used, the smoothed values represent geometric
averages, which are more difficult to interpret. We recommend using raw
counts if possible. This argument is only used if the input is a
\code{SpatialExperiment} object. Default = \code{counts}.}

\item{spatialcoords}{Numeric matrix of spatial coordinates, assumed to
contain x coordinates in first column and y coordinates in second column.
This argument is only used if the input is a numeric matrix.}

\item{method}{Method used for smoothing. Options are \code{uniform},
\code{kernel}, and \code{knn}. The \code{uniform} method calculates
unweighted averages across spatial locations within a circular window with
radius \code{bandwidth} at each spatial location, which smooths out spatial
variability as well as sparsity due to sampling variability. The
\code{kernel} method calculates a weighted average using a truncated
exponential kernel applied to Euclidean distances with a length scale
parameter equal to \code{bandwidth}, which provides a more sophisticated
approach to smoothing out spatial variability but may be affected by
sparsity due to sampling variability (especially sparsity at the index
point), and is computationally slower. The \code{knn} method calculates an
unweighted average across the index point and its k nearest neighbors, and
is the fastest method. Default = \code{uniform}.}

\item{bandwidth}{Bandwidth parameter for smoothing, expressed as proportion
of width or height (whichever is greater) of tissue area. Only used for
\code{method = "uniform"} or \code{method = "kernel"}. For \code{method =
"uniform"}, the bandwidth represents the radius of a circle, and unweighted
averages are calculated across neighboring points within this circle. For
\code{method = "kernel"}, the averaging is weighted by distances scaled
using a truncated exponential kernel applied to Euclidean distances. For
example, a bandwidth of 0.05 will smooth values across neighbors weighted
by distances scaled using a truncated exponential kernel with length scale
equal to 5% of the width or height (whichever is greater) of the tissue
area. Weights for \code{method = "kernel"} are truncated at small values
for computational efficiency. Default = 0.05.}

\item{truncate}{Truncation threshold parameter if \code{method = "kernel"}.
Kernel weights below this value are set to zero for computational
efficiency. Only used for \code{method = "kernel"}. Default = 0.05.}

\item{k}{Number of nearest neighbors parameter for \code{method = "knn"}.
Only used for \code{method == "knn"}. Unweighted averages are calculated
across the index point and its k nearest neighbors. Default = 18 (based on
two layers in honeycomb pattern for 10x Genomics Visium platform).}

\item{keep_unsmoothed}{Whether to keep unsmoothed expression values if the
input is a \code{SpatialExperiment}. If TRUE, these will be stored in a new
\code{assay} named \code{<assay_name>_unsmoothed} (e.g.
\code{counts_unsmoothed}). Only used if the input is a
\code{SpatialExperiment} object.}
}
\value{
Returns spatially smoothed expression values, which can then be used
  as the input for further downstream analyses. Results are returned either
  as a \code{SpatialExperiment} object containing an updated \code{assay}
  named \code{assay_name} (e.g. \code{counts}), or as a numeric matrix,
  depending on the input type.

\description{
Spatial clustering algorithm for spatial transcriptomics data.
}
\details{
Spatial clustering algorithm for spatial transcriptomics data based on the
principle of smoothing expression measurements across neighboring spatial
locations. The algorithm can be used to define spatial domains consisting of
a consistent mixture of cell types with smooth spatial boundaries.
